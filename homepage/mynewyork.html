        <h1 class= "title"><u>My Unpopular Opinion on New York</u></h1>
        
        <div class= "essay">
          <p>When people think of good neighborhoods in New York, they might think of places like West Village, Tribeca/Little Italy, and Battery Park just to name a few. What do these places have in common? For one, these places are located in Manhattan. What's more relevant, though, is that these neighborhoods have the highest median and mean incomes. In shorter words, they are the "richer" neighborhoods.</p>
          <p>At first thought, it might seem like my words are coming from Captain Obvious when I say that rich neighborhoods <i>are</i> good neighborhoods. Before emigrating to the U.S., I thought too that rich neighborhoods are by default good neighborhoods. However, after arriving here, my opinions on what makes a good neighborhood have become more nuanced. I used to live in Canarsie, but I now live in Sheepshead Bay. People might say Canarsie is a subpar place to live for varying reasons/causes. However, I will still go on to say that Canarsie is better than many of the gentrified neighborhoods. Why? It’s because of community. Without the presence of community, a neighborhood just turns to a place where people happen to co-exist in. It is only in New York where it is normal to pay attention to only yourself and nobody else, which has its benefits, but has much more drawbacks nonetheless. Let me ask you a question. In your neighborhood, when was the last time you saw people recognizing their neighbors and having a chat with them? I am sure many of you feel does not apply to your neighborhood, but in Sheepshead Bay, communication between neighbors is relatively scarce. When I lived in Canarsie and especially in my home country Nigeria, everyone knew their neighbors’ names; people would sit with their neighbors and have little chats with them. Maybe it's because many of my neighbors were either African or Caribbean (and the same applies in Nigeria). However, Sheepshead Bay is a place that is <b>packed</b> with immigrants, and yet it doesn't change the fact that many people in Sheepshead Bay probably do not know their neighbors' names, and I am basing this off my observation that they do not speak to each other. In Nigeria, knowing your neighbors can be the difference between being killed or not. However, let us depart from Nigeria and go back to talking about the great U.S of A. I think the concept of "Southern hospitality" (<a href="https://www.waterstoneonaugusta.com/how-to-show-southern-hospitality/">more info about that here</a>) displays just how non-interactive people in New York,and the North in general, are. </p>
          <p>To give you a better idea about how the sense of community plays into my personal sense of the true worth of a neighborhood, I would like to give a personal (and probably inaccurate if you look at a real map) map of Sheepshead Bay. In the twenty or so blocks around my house, there are four different parts which I have divided based on race. The first part of the neighborhood is mostly inhabited by Jewish people. This part of the neighborhood has nice houses and buildings; the trees and flowers look and smell wonderful; the atmosphere is one of serenity despite the constant noise. These are the things I like about the neighborhood, but it does not compare to the other parts because of community. I say this because there is little to no interaction between the residents of the neighborhood. As a result, the neighborhood feels boring. It feels like the kind of boring when I am home alone. I come from a country where there is always something to do, and something is always happening around all the points of the compass. This part is not as fine as the first part, but I like it more because the people there seem to be a little familiar with each other because there are many conversations between groups of two or three in the area, whether it is on the sidewalk or in open-air supermarkets that are common in this area. Whenever I go to this part of the neighborhood, it feels like home because of the interactions in those supermarkets and the fact that they are mostly immigrants. The last part of the neighborhood is where most black people live. The sense of community is pretty similar to the one in the other part of the neighborhood. However, I would say that the people there know each other the most out of the other neighborhoods. You see groups of kids, teens, and maybe adults sitting and talking to each other; or you can see them playing basketball with each other. It makes this part worth coming to because you can see that everyone is not in their little world, especially in this age where social media only makes it worse. When I go to that part of the neighborhood, I get the feeling that most of the neighbors are like family because they act so much like a family. This is what community in a neighborhood can do. It turns people from just residents to family. In a neighborhood with community, when you have no other place to turn to, you go to your neighbors because they are family. I am sure that this has helped a lot of people to strive through the hardships that come their way.</p>
