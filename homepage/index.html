        <h1 id="indextitle">Welcome and Hello!</h1>
        <p class="intro">This is the webpage where I give my opinion on the supposedly great New York, aka the Big Apple, the City that never sleeps, and the Empire State in the U.S. Oh, you were asking for my name? It's Harold. Nice to have you here. Although this page is supposed to guide you in this webpage, you will need a little context for you to understand, so I'll have to give a very brief history of my life. Anyways, I am 15 years old and I was born on May 17th, 2005 in Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria; I lived in that area for most of my life, but that ended when my family and I emigrated to the U.S. back in 2017. My favorite things to do are playing and watching soccer games. Anyways, now that I have introdced myself, if you press "Maps", you will see me showing the map of Brooklyn and the different places I will be referring to in "About Canarsie". To locate my essay about New York, simply press "Essay".</p>
